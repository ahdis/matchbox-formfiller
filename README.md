# matchbox-ng angular frontend to matchbox

see latest [test release](https://test.ahdis.ch/matchbox/#/)

angular web applications which uses fhir for:

- Validation of FHIR resources

built with:

- using [fhir-kit-client](https://github.com/Vermonster/fhir-kit-client) for accessing a fhir server
- integrated [fhirpath.js](https://github.com/lhncbc/fhirpath.js/)
- using [angular material](https://material.angular.io/) for UI components

Note:
Chrome on OSX has a CORS Problem and cannot execute te $extract operation, this happens only to a http url, but not to a https url

- Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: Redirect is not allowed for a preflight request.
- Looks like this could happen: For those struggling with this in the future, the problem was that the URL was returning a 302-Redirect, and even though the new location was presenting CORS headers with 200-OK, the initial 302 response was not.

# development setup

if you are not using the devcontainer from this project with [VS Code Remote Development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) extension you need to have angular cli and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) installed:

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
npm install
ng build --configuration development
```

and then

ng serve --configuration development

## usage

Run `ng serve --configuration development` to start the app, app will be at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200/).
If you use the Visual Code functionality with Remote containers: Open Folder in container option, you need to start it with `ng serve --host 0.0.0.0`.

if you use localhost and have cross site blocking issues within chrome start chrome directly from command line (osx)
